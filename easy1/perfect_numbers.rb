# The Greek mathematician Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for 
# natural numbers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories 
# of abundant, perfect, or deficient. A perfect number equals the sum of its
# positive divisors â€” the pairs of numbers whose product yields the target 
# number, excluding the number itself. This sum is known as the Aliquot sum.

# Perfect: Sum of factors = number
# Abundant: Sum of factors > number
# Deficient: Sum of factors < number


# Examples:

# 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 3 and 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.
# 28 is a perfect number because 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
# Prime numbers 7, 13, etc are deficient by the Nicomachus classification.
# Write a program that can tell if a number is perfect, abundant or deficient.

# Input: An integer
# Output: A string or raise a RuntimeError

# Data Structure:
#   integer, sum the factors as you go
#   Could use an array to push all of the factors to and then sum them

# Considerations:
#   Raise a RuntimeError if num <= 0
#   floats?
#   method is a class method

# Algorithm:
#   Iterate from 1 to square root of num
#   if num % iterator is 0, add iterator and num / iterator to sum
#   return sum

    result = (2..Math.sqrt(num)).inject(1) do |sum, divisor|
